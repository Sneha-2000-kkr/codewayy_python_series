#Question1

#Working with integers

#Initialization of variables
number1 = 50
number2 = 30
sum = 0
product = 0

#Calculating the results
sum = number1 + number2
product = number1 * number2

#Printing the results
print("The Sum is = ", sum)
print("The Product is = ", product)
print(" ")

#Working with float

#Initialization of variables
number1 = 12.5
number2 = 15.2
sum = 0
product = 0

#Calculating the results
sum = number1 + number2
product = number1 * number2

#Printing the results
print("The Sum is = ", sum)
print("The Product is = ", product)
print(" ")
